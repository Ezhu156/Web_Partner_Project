	var text=["CBoba guys is great. I got the oolong milk tea with grass jelly and zero sugar (as I always do). My gf got a Thai iced tea which was bomb. Why was it bomb? Mainly because it had sooooooo much sugar in it it was as if a bomb had exploded into the Thai iced tea and it just floated around. But hey that was good. My sister told me a story about how she met the boba guys owner in SF. What a concept!  -Willy X.", "Super glad these guys are over here in NY. Boba guys were my favorite boba guys, well one of them in the Bay Area. I had their horchata and unfortunately I didn't enjoy it as much as other people did. The actual quality of the boba was on point just like back home. My fiancÃ© had the strawberry matcha and it was delicious except I'm not a big matcha fan. Later did I find out what the strawberry cali pico is. I'll definitely get that next time -Heather S.", "Boba guys has set the standard for bubble tea. It is nestled on Clinton street near prohibition bakery and Clinton street baking company. It's a small shop with always a huge line especially at all hours on weekends. All their teas uses loose leaf and high quality matcha. This review will be short as most people who read my reviews - I tend to go a few times before writing a review. I can say I've been here more than a few times and have tried the recommended premium ones and the seasonal specials - none have disappointed. For first timers - highly recommend the matcha latte or jasmine milk tea - both are excellent. From there - you can spread your wings and tastebuds go! -Kevin H." ];
